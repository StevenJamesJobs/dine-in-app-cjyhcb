Since Supabase is available, the user can enable it to handle authentication.\n2.  **Create Customer Tabs:** Create the \"Menus & Specials,\" \"Social & Events,\" and \"About Us\" tabs.\n3.  **Implement Rewards System:** Create a basic rewards system display.\n4.  **Create Employee Tabs:** Create the \"Dashboard\" and \"Training Materials\" tabs.\n5.  **Implement Employee Dashboard:** Add weather and schedule display to the employee dashboard.\n6.  **Implement Color Themes:** Apply the specified color schemes to the customer and employee sides.\n\nI will now create a plan for the coding agent to implement these changes.\n\n"}, {"type": "file_tree", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I have the file tree.

This will likely involve modifying the `RootLayout` component.\n    *   Add a button or toggle to switch between customer and employee modes.\n\n2.  **app/(tabs)/\\_layout.tsx:**\n    *   Modify the tab layout to reflect the customer or employee view. This means different tabs will be rendered based on the selected mode.\n    *   For the customer view, the tabs should be \"Menus & Specials\", \"Social & Events\", and \"About Us\" (and potentially \"Rewards\").\n    *   For the employee view, the tabs should be \"Dashboard\" and \"Training Materials\".\n    *   Update the `TabLayout` component to conditionally render the appropriate tabs.\n\n3.  **app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx:**\n    *   This file currently represents the home screen. Modify it to serve as either the customer \"Menus & Specials\" page or the employee \"Dashboard\" based on the selected mode.\n    *   If in customer mode, display menu and specials information.\n    *   If in employee mode, display daily information, weather (this will require fetching data from an external API), and the employee's schedule.\n\n4.  **Create New Files (if necessary):**\n    *   Create new files for the \"Social & Events\", \"About Us\", \"Rewards\", and \"Training Materials\" pages. These files should be placed in the `app/(tabs)` directory to be part of the tab navigation.\n\n5.  **components/button.tsx:**\n    *   Modify the button component to accept a color prop to be able to change the color of the button for the employee side.\n\n6.  **constants/Colors.ts:**\n    *   Add the color palettes for both the customer and employee sides as defined in the design elements section.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\n*   **Authentication:** For simplicity, initially, just implement a mock authentication system (e.g., a boolean state variable indicating whether the user is logged in and whether they are a customer or employee). Later, the user can enable Supabase for real authentication.\n*   **Data Fetching:** For the employee dashboard, use a placeholder for weather data initially.\n*   **Styling:** Apply the specified color schemes using the `useTheme` hook from `@react-navigation/native` and the colors defined in `constants/Colors.ts`.\n\n**After the coding agent has implemented the above, remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.**\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-03T18:02:04.098270"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create this restaurant app with separate customer and employee sections.
